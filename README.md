# 🎀Cosmetic Recommender

A content-based recommendation system that compares and visualizes moisturizers based on their chemical ingredients and skin type compatibility using t-SNE and Bokeh.

## 💡 Project Overview

This project was part of a data science traineeship where I was given a dataset of cosmetic products and their ingredients.

The main goal? To build a system that recommends similar products based not only on their *ingredients* — but also their suitability for different **skin types** like oily, dry, or sensitive.

## 🧪 Tools & Tech Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data cleaning & preprocessing  
- **t-SNE** – to reduce dimensionality and find clusters  
- **Bokeh** – for interactive visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔍 What I Did

- Cleaned and transformed ingredient data into usable form  
- Included **skin type** as a filter layer in the recommendation logic  
- Reduced ingredient complexity using t-SNE  
- Created visual plots to understand product similarity  
- Built a basic recommendation approach based on ingredient & skin-type compatibility

## ✨ Key Learnings

- Learned how to apply dimensionality reduction on real-world messy data  
- Realized how critical **user needs (like skin type)** are for useful recommendations  
- Practiced working with interactive visual tools  
- Got better at asking “what actually helps the user?”

## 📁 Files Included

- `cosmetic_recommender.ipynb` – Main project notebook  
- `data.csv` – The dataset (modified/cleaned version)  
- `report.pdf` – A short write-up of the entire process and findings

Always open to feedback, thoughts, or skin-care collabs powered by Python ;)
